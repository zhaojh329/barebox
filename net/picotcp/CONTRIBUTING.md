External contributions to picoTCP are very welcome. We do, however, ask that you sign the Contributor License Agreement.
We don't ask you to sign away your copyright. The CLA simply grants us an additional license on the code you wrote. This allows us to also use picoTCP in commercial projects, which enables us to keep investing time and money in creating a better TCP/IP stack.

Please read the [Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-z6lsT75l6ZIrgHGEWrWdHylJ6xxpjc7FwGfL2ilDFU/viewform), and if you agree with it, fill in your information. 
You will receive a mail with a timestamp. Please modify our [CLA confirmation page](https://github.com/tass-belgium/picotcp/wiki/picoTCP-CLA-Confirmation-Page), adding the timestamp and your github username. This way we can be sure that nobody else filled in your info in the form.

Pull requests by people who haven't signed the CLA will, unfortunately, have to be rejected.
