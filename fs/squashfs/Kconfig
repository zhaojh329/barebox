	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 4.0 (a Compressed
	  Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only
	  filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib, lzo or xz compression to
	  compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system
	  are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
	  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes
	  (default block size 128K).  SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems
	  and files (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and
	  timestamps.

	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for
	  archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in
	  embedded systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information
	  and tools are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.
